## How do societies measure up to Life's Principles?

This project aims to explore how to use best practices from nature, described as [Life's Principles](https://biomimicry.net/the-buzz/resources/designlens-lifes-principles/) in the field of [Biomimicry](https://youtu.be/sf4oW8OtaPY), to evaluate the state of societies and compare that to other performance indices.

The goal is to build an [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) web application that gathers results of prior indeces, measures that can be used to assess the principles and allows users to explore the state of countries, how they have evolved over time and how they compare to neighbours and all other countries.

* the [liveso folder](https://github.com/codrin-kruijne/liveso/tree/master/liveso) holds all the web application files
* the app prototype is published on [ShinyApps.io](https://codrin.shinyapps.io/liveso/)
